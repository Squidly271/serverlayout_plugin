#Server Layout plugin for unRAID v6

The *Server Layout* plugin enables you to view the devices (HDDs, CD/DVD ROMS) in a physical manner.
You can configure the server’s disk tray layout, assign each storage device to a drive tray and enter additional data manually (Purchase Date, etc…)

##To install under unRAID v6:
1. In the unRAID Plugin Manager under "Install Plugin" tab enter https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theone11/serverlayout_plugin/master/virtualbox.plg
2. Wait for installation to complete.
3. Go to plugin WEGUI and change initial settings

##To update the plugin:
* For WEBUI and functionality updates - Use the unRAID Plugin Manager

##The WEBUI is divided into 3 parts/tabs:
1. Layout:
   - Shows the Server Layout as was configured in the Settings tab.
2. Data:
   - Shows the Server Data (Installed and Historical) and allows adding and editing of manual data.
   - Preview the drive tray assignments.
3. Settings:
   - Configure Server Layout (Rows/Comlumns) and Drive orientation (Horizontal/Vertical).
   - Configure which fields should be shown per drive on the Layout tab and data field columns in Data tab.
